<!--
With so many great tools available to front-end web developers these days it
can sometimes be difficult to understand how they all fit together. Deciding on
a workflow that you’re happy with is often a very personal endeavor, but getting
started isn’t always easy.

Both enterprises and start-ups will need to take advantage of these tools as the
demand for features and quick delivery rises. Building applications with these
tools can speed development and deployment, simplify project organization, and
automate repetitive tasks allowing developers to focus on core features.

We'll be following Hanson as they review a dizzying array of projects with advanced
front-end JavaScript components and discuss about how they're improving their
workflow with tools like Node/NPM, Grunt, Yeoman, Bower, Require.js, and Handlebars.

not about just writing a script
creating a robust architecture
make sense of the incredibly complex world of front-end dev

# To --save or --save-dev
- --save and --save-dev mark libraries as dependencies
in your package.json file.
- People who just want to use your library (not modify it) can use the --production flag to not download dev dependencies.
- If a library is required for your package to
run, use --save
- If a library is only required for someone who
wants to compile your package, use --save-dev

    <aside class="notes">
        - There's a debate about whether you should check NPM and Bower libraries into source control.
        - It's a lot of files, and it's not strictly necessary.
        - As long as you're using `--save` or `--save-dev`, all your npm dependencies get written to your package.json file.

	# Installing Grunt
	Start by installing the grunt-cli npm package:

	```npm install -g grunt-cli```

	Now you can run the `grunt` command from any directory.

	Grunt needs an instruction file called Gruntfile.js to tell it what to do next.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	# Installing Gulp

	- Grunt has gruntfile.js. Gulp has gulpfile.js.
	- Gruntfiles provide configuration in the form of deep objects. The action happens inside the plugins.
	- Gulpfiles contain little procedural programs that chain together the output of many single-purpose plugins.

	# That Bower pro-tip I promised
	- Use [grunt-bower-concat](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-bower-concat) to copy and concatenate all your Bower
	dependencies into a single file.
	- grunt-bower-concat grabs the main file from each
	Bower package (plus anything else you tell it to grab) and concatenates it into single file
	- You can create sub-tasks to compile subsets of dependencies

	# Problem: Scaffolding a new project
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	# Solution: Yeoman
	![ ](img/yeoman-logo.png)
	- Yeoman is a project scaffolding system. It can give you a fresh, clean project structure for many types of apps
	- Install Yo like so:

	``npm install -g yo````

	- To use Yeoman, you install various generators.
	- A generator is a template for creating an application, like a Bootstrap 3 app or an AngularJS app.
	- Here is a very long list of generators: http://yeoman.io/community-generators.html

<section data-markdown>
	# Dependency management
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	# Why dependency management?
	- Script tags are not a dependency management strategy
	- “[D]ependencies [in JavaScript] are very weakly stated: the developer needs to know the right dependency order.
	For instance, The file containing Backbone cannot come before the jQuery tag.”
	- Discrete classes = looser coupling, better maintainability and encapsulation
	- The more classes you have, the more likely you are to run into out-of-order dependencies
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	# Some options
	## CommonJS modules
	- Developed as part of a larger project to separate Javascript from the browser
	- Popular implementation is Browserify
	- Synchronous
	- Not particularly browser-friendly
	## Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)
	- Developed to address shortcomings in CommonJS modules
	- Popular implementation is Require.js -- list others
	- Asynchronous, well-suited for web use
	- We’ve used it successfully on many projects
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	# About require.js
	![Require.js](img/requirejs.png)

	- *“Require.js is a JavaScript file and module loader. It is optimized for in-browser use, but it can be used in
	other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node. Using a modular script loader like Require.js will improve the
	speed and quality of your code.”*
	- Require.js helps you manage dependencies so you don’t have to worry about the order in which scripts are loaded
	- Has a powerful build process so you can deploy pre-built versions of your script to production.
	```bower install requirejs```
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	# About require.js
	- Require.js has two basic methods, require() and define().
	- `require()` loads scripts asynchronously based on a slash-separated path, like this:
	```require("APP/controllers/main");```
	- `define()` exports Javascript modules in such a way that require can keep track of them. Require.js keeps a
	registry of modules it’s already loaded, so if you need a class more than once it isn’t loaded multiple times.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	# What about non-AMD libraries?
	- No problem. Require.js’s config file allows you to shim non-AMD Javascript. Shimming looks like this:
	```
	shim: {
	'lib/jqueryui': {
	deps: ['lib/jquery']
	}
	}
	```
	- Now I can require('lib/jqueryui') in my classes, and it will added the AMD registry. Require will also make sure
	all dependencies are loaded when this one is requested.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	# Demo require.js setup on the Prophet
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	# Loader plugins
	- “Require.js supports loader plugins. This is a way to support dependencies that are not plain JS files, but are
	still important for a script to have loaded before it can do its work. The Require.js wiki has a list of plugins.
	This section talks about some specific plugins that are maintained alongside Require.js:”
	- Example, The text loader plugin:
	```require('text!templates/applyProducts/_products-line.hbs');```
	- This plugin can be used to load plain text files into a Javascript variable.
	- Full list of plugins here [https://github.com/jrburke/Require.js/wiki/Plugins]()
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	# Building and deploying require.js
	- The Require.js optimizer combines related scripts together into build layers and minifies them with UglifyJS or
	Closure Compiler.
	- It scans your require() statements, loads all the dependencies and inlines them into the top of the file. Then it
	minifies everything and outputs it to a directory of your choosing (we prefer js-built).
	- This makes it trivial to select the /content/js directory (for dev) or /content/js-built (for staging and
	production). Nothing else needs to change in your code or your config!
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	# Speed improvements
	- Unbuilt JS:
	![ ](img/unbuilt.jpg)
	- Built JS:
	![ ](img/built.jpg)
	Generate new graphics
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	# Integrating with a build process
	- The Require.js optimizer can be run as a build task with node or with Rhino for Java. Node is much, much faster.
	On Menards Shelving, the Require.js build takes ~60 seconds locally with Node, but over 10 minutes(!!) when run as
	part of the build using Rhino.
	- To improve performance, set skipDirOptimize: true, and minify your third-party JS libraries some other way.

<section data-markdown>
	# About JSDoc
	- JSDoc ([http://usejsdoc.org/]()) is a tool for generating HTML documentation from structured JavaScript comments
	- JSDoc 3.3 runs in Node.js (or Mozilla Rhino) and can be installed with npm
	```npm install -g jsdoc```
	- Once installed, navigate to where your JS files are located in a terminal and run this command:
	```jsdoc -r .```
</section>

<section data-markdown>
	JSDOC SYNTAX
	- Syntax is very similar to Javadoc.
	Any comment beginning with /** is interpreted as a JSDoc comment.
	// not picked up by JSdoc
	/* not picked up by JSdoc */
	/** Hello JSdoc */
	Don't put everything in your JSdoc
	You can add meaning with tags
	There are many tags beginning with
	@ that help make your docs better.
	/**
	* @constructor
	* @alias MEN.ui.configurator.VizProduct
	* @extends MEN.ui.configurator.VizItem
	@param {String} mything

	* @classdesc A component of a design, such as a shelf, basket or
